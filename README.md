----Difference Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript:

In Typescript, both interfaces and type are used to define the shape of objects.but they have key differences in usage and flexibility:

Interface: interface is declared using the (interface keywords) and Interface can be merged. Interface is best for defining object structures that can be extended later. When defining object structures that might grow with additional properties, interfaces are a good choice.

Type: type is declared using the (type keywords) and Type can be used to define a typographical alias for a type. Type is best for defining a new name for an existing type. When typing a value that is already known, types are a good choice.Specially when working with complex types like unions, tuples, or primitive-based combination.
